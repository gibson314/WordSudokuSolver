# WordSudokuSolver
Sudoku is a puzzle that has gained much popularity since its first release in a US Newspaper in 2004. The object of the original Sudoku is to fill in a partially-completed 9x9 grid with numbers 1-9 such that each row, column, and the nine 3x3 sub-grids contain no duplicate numbers. In this assignment, you will implement a variation on Sudoku where, instead of filling the grid with numbers, you will fill the grid with words. You will be given a word bank, or a list of words that must be used exactly once (unless otherwise specified), and you must arrange them so that every cell in the grid contains a letter. Note that words will take up multiple cells in the grid and can be oriented either horizontally or vertically, and words are allowed to overlap. Following the rules of Sudoku, each row, column, and 3x3 cell cannot contain duplicate letters.
